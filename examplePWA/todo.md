# in general
    * absolutely none of the layout stuff seems to work on phones
      the dimensions are just too extreme (damn! it is at least fixable I s'pose)
      thought: move from defining dimensions by em to vh or vw based on orientation
      and media queries.

# noiceExamplePWA.js

    * handleSyncWorkerStatusUpdate()
    * crashedDialog()
    * resetApp()
    * exportFile()
    * [wip] startup()


# serviceWorker.js
    * syntax validate and test from console

# syncWorker.js
    * phoneHome()

# mainUI.js
    * everything

# recordEditor.js
    * everything

# recordFormView.js
    * implement rowHandle as a getter of this class this time round
    * everything

# noiceExamplePWA.css
    * the fun part :-)

# noiceCoreUIFormElement / value getter
    * breaks valueStreamCallback, so we need to fix coreUIScannerInput
